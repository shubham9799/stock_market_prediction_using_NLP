\# News2Returns: Predicting Stock Returns from News



\*\*NLP-driven prediction of next-day returns in the Indian stock market\*\*



This project applies natural language processing (NLP) models to Indian stock market news in order to predict whether the next day's returns will be \*\*positive\*\* or \*\*negative\*\*. The goal is to build a framework for trading strategies that mimic human decision-making but with the speed and objectivity of algorithms.

\## üìñ Motivation



\- \*\*Human-like decision making\*\*: Semantic neural models can interpret financial news in ways similar to how humans form market opinions.  

\- \*\*Emotion-free trading\*\*: Algorithms act based on scores, not on biases or preconceived notions.  

\- \*\*Strategic advantage\*\*: Quick and accurate response to news can provide an edge in trading.

\## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology



1\. \*\*Data Collection\*\*  

&nbsp;  - Indian stock market news articles (to be uploaded soon).  

&nbsp;  - Corresponding stock returns.  



2\. \*\*Preprocessing\*\*  

&nbsp;  - Text cleaning, tokenization, and embedding generation.  

&nbsp;  - Label assignment: Positive / Negative (Neutral to be added in future).  



3\. \*\*Modeling\*\*  

&nbsp;  - Semantic neural models (NLP-based).  

&nbsp;  - Baseline ML models for comparison.  

&nbsp;  - Evaluation of predictive accuracy.  



4\. \*\*Extensions\*\*  

&nbsp;  - Incorporating \*\*Neutral\*\* label for more realistic sentiment distribution.  

&nbsp;  - Feature extraction via \*\*unsupervised ML\*\* for richer event mapping.  

&nbsp;  - Potential application to \*\*options trading strategies\*\*.

\## üìä Results (Summary)



\- Initial models demonstrate promising ability to classify news sentiment and predict next-day returns.  

\- Performance can be improved with better feature extraction and inclusion of neutral events.
